1. I searched  \s{37}([A-Z]+((\s|-)?[A-Z]+)) to find the lines the characters said. 
I replaced it with <character>\1</character>  this changed the formatting slightly, and it picked up on stage directions. 
1.a. To fix that, I searched <character>(FADE OUT)</character>  and replaced it with \1  Same with INT and EXT
2. I searched \s{17}(EXT.+) and replaced it with <setting>\1</setting>  I did the same with INT
