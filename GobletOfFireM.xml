                         So Hogwarts has been choosen to host 
                         a legendary event. The Tri-Wizard tournament. 
                         Now for those of you who do not know, 
                         the tri-wizard tournament brings together 
                         three schools for a series of magical 
                         contests. From each school a single 
                         contestant is selected to compete. Now 
                         let me be clear, if choosen you stand 
                         alone. And trust me when I say these 
                         contests are not for the faint hearted, 
                         but more of that later. For now please 
                         join me in welcoming the lovely ladies 
                         of the Beauxbatons Academy of magic

<speech><speaker name="RON">RON</speaker>
                         Because nobody asked her. I would have

                         The enemy?? Who was it wanting his autograph? 
                         Besides, the whole point of the tournament 
                         is international magical cooperation,

                         (Over a loudspeaker) Welcome to the 
                         second task. Last night something was 
                         stolen from each of our champions. A 
                         treasure of sorts. These four treasures, 
                         one for each champion, now lie on the 
                         bottom of the black lake. In order to 
                         win each champion need only find their 
                         treasure and return to the surface. 
                         Simple enough. Except for this, they 
                         will have one hour to do so and one 
                         hour only. After that they'll be on 
                         their own.</speech>

                         a wee bit stretched. It allows me to 
                         see what small things I've already seen.

                         (Speaking to all pupils) Today we acknowledge 
                         a really terrible loss. <ref name="Cedric_Diggory">Cedric Diggory</ref> 
                         was as you all know, exceptionally hard 
                         working, intricately fair minded. And 
                         most importantly a fierce fierce friend. 
                         I think therefore you have the right 
                         to know exactly how he died. You see, 
                         <ref name="Cedric_Diggory">Cedric Diggory</ref> was murdered by <ref name="Voldemort">Lord 
                         Voldemort.</ref> The ministry of magic does 
                         not wish me to tell you this. But not 
                         to do so I think would be an insult 
                         to his memory. Now the pain we all feel 
                         at this dreadful loss reminds me, reminds 
                         us that while we may come from different 
                         places and speak in different tongues, 
                         our hearts beat as one. In light of 
                         recent events the bonds of friendship 
                         we made this year will be more important 
                         than ever. Remember that and <ref name="Cedric_Diggory">Cedric</ref> 
                         Diggory will not have died in vain, 
                         you remember that. And we'll celebrate 
                         a boy who was kind and honest and brave 
                         and true right to the very end.</speech>
