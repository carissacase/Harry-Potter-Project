      <p>We home in on a snake crawling through the undergrowth.</p>
      
      
      <p>TITLES</p>
      
      
      <h5><strong>INT. DARK ROOM - NIGHT TIME</strong></h5>
      
      
      <p>An old man lights a gas oven with a match, he is preparing food. 
         He notices a light on in the large house opposite, he stops what 
         he's doing and walks to the door.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>OLD MAN</h4>
         Bloody kids.</p>
      
      
      <p>He leaves the house and heads towards the light.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <h5><strong>EXT. DARKNESS</strong></h5>
      
      
      <p>The old man is wandering up to the house carrying a lit torch.
         He opens the front door, inside is just as dark. He begins climbing 
         the stairs, we hear whispers and hushed voices coming from upstairs. 
         The old man waits outside the room where the conversation is 
         taking place and listens on.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>WORMTAIL</h4>
         Oh no no no my Lord Voldemort. I only 
         meant... perhaps if we were to do it 
         without the boy..</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>VOLDEMORT</h4>
         NO! The boy is everything, it cannot 
         be done without him and it WILL be done 
         exactly as I say.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>UNKNOWN MAN</h4>
         I will not disappoint you my lord.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>VOLDEMORT</h4>
         Good. First, gather our old comrades. 
         Send them a sign.</p>
      
      
      <p>A snake slithers past the old man and into the room. </p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>VOLDEMORT</h4>
         Nagini tells me the old caretaker is 
         standing outside the door.</p>
      
      
      <p>Wormtail stands in the doorway and looks at the old man. The 
         old man looks terrified.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>VOLDEMORT</h4>
         Step aside so I can give our guest a 
         proper greeting.</p>
      
      
      <p>A loud spell is cast and Harry  wakes up in a flash of panic.</p>

      <p>Harry  is flustered and still panicking.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>HERMIONE</h4>
         Are you alright?</p>

         Last night.</p>
      
      
      <p>Hermione goes over to Ron's bed.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>HERMIONE</h4>

         Where are we actually going?</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>RON</h4>
         Don't know. Hey Dad! Where are we going?</p>

         <h4>AMOS</h4>

      <p>
         <h4>ARTHUR</h4>
         Sorry Amos. Some of us had a bit of 
         a sleepy start. This is Amos Diggory
         everyone, he works with me at the ministry. 
         And this strapping young lad must be 
         Cedric, am I right?</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>CEDRIC</h4>
         Yes sir.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>AMOS</h4>
         Merlin's beard, you must be  Harry Potter.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>HARRY</h4>
         Yes sir. This way.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>AMOS</h4>
         Great great pleasure.</p>
      
      
      <p>They shake hands.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>HARRY</h4>
         Pleasure to meet you too sir.</p>
      
      
      <p>They walk on up the hill.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>ARTHUR</h4>
         That's it sir, just over there.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>AMOS</h4>
         Shall we? We don't want to be late.</p>
      
      
      
      <p>Camera homes in on a boot on top of the hillside.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>HARRY</h4>
         Why are they all standing around that 
         manky old boot?</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>FRED</h4>
         That isn't just any old manky boot mate.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>GEORGE</h4>
         It's a portkey.</p>
      
      
      <p>Everyone is in a circle putting their hands on the boot.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>AMOS</h4>
         Time to go. Ready?</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>HARRY</h4>
         What's a 'portkey'?</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>AMOS</h4>
         After 3. One... Two...</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>ARTHUR</h4>
         Harry!</p>
      
      
      <p>Harry  rushes over and puts his hand on the boot.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>AMOS</h4>
         Three!</p>
      
      
      <p>There's a white flash and suddenly they're all flying through 
         the air. Everyone cheers. </p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>ARTHUR</h4>
         Let go kids!</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>HERMIONE</h4>
         What??</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>ARTHUR</h4>
         Let! Go!</p>
      
      
      <p>Harry, Hermione and the young Weasleys crash to the ground with 
         a thump. Arthur, Amos and Cedric come down more gracefully.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>ARTHUR</h4>
         I bet that cleared your sinuses eh?</p>
      
      
      
      <p>Cedric helps Harry  to his feet.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>HARRY</h4>
         Thanks.</p>
      
      
      <p>They walk across the field and we see there's a massive crowd 
         gathered and cheering, tents are set up all over.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>ARTHUR</h4>
         Well kids, welcome to the Quidditch 
         World Cup!</p>
      
      
      <p>They walk into the crowd, taking in the sights. Music is playing 
         and people fly about overhead on brooms. They approach a small 
         tent.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>AMOS</h4>

         see you at the match.</p>

      <h5><strong>INT. TENT</strong></h5>
      
      
      <p>They enter the tent, the inside is many times bigger than the 
         outside.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>ARTHUR</h4>
         Girls. Choose a bunk and unpack. Ron, 
         get out of the kitchen we're all hungry.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>TWINS</h4>

      <p>
         <h4>TWINS</h4>
         Feet off the table.</p>
      
      
      <p>They take their feet off the table and put them back on as soon 
         as Arthur has walked past.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>HARRY</h4>
         (Smiling) I love magic.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <h5><strong>EXT. HILLSIDE</strong></h5>
      
      
      <p>We pan up the hillside onto a large stadium which seems to have 
         a huge number of floors.</p>
      
      
      
      <h5><strong>INT. STADIUM</strong></h5>
      
      
      <p>The Weasleys and Harry  are finding their seats.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>RON</h4>
         Blimey Dad, how far up ARE we?</p>
      
      
      <p>Lucius Malfoy and Draco are walking below them.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>LUCIUS</h4>
         Well put it this way, if it rains... 
         you'll be the first to know</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>DRACO</h4>
         Father and I are in the minister's box, 
         by personal invitation of Cornelius 
         Fudge himself.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>LUCIUS</h4>
         Don't boast Draco. There's no need with 
         these people. Do enjoy yourself won't 
         you. While you can.</p>
      
      
      <p>The ceremonies begin. Balloons fly and fireworks go off.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>ARTHUR</h4>
         Come on up, take your seats. I told 
         you these seats would be worth waiting 
         for.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>GEORGE</h4>

      <p>
         <h4>FRED</h4>
         It's the Irish!</p>
      
      
      <p>Five green and white figures fly through the air on their brooms 
         leaving a colored trail behind them. A glittering leprechaun 
         appears in the sky and starts dancing. Everyone is excited.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>GEORGE</h4>
         Here come the Bulgarians!</p>
      
      
      <p>Five red figures this time, one of them performs a stunt on his 
         broom. One of them appears on the large screen. The crowd begins 
         to chant 'Krum, Krum, Krum'. </p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>WEASLEYS</h4>
         Krum!!!</p>

         Yes!</p>
      
      
      <p>Viktor Krum waves to the crowd.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>ANNOUNCER</h4>
         Good evening! It gives me great pleasure 
         to welcome each and every one of you 
         to the final of the 422nd Quidditch 
         World Cup. Let the match begin!</p>

      <p>
         <h4>RON</h4>
         There's no one like Krum. He's like 
         a bird the way he rides the wind. He's 
         more than an athlete, he's an artist.</p>
      
      
      
      <p>The twins are bumbling about in a comical way muttering 'KRUMMMM'.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>GINNY</h4>

         <h4>TWINS</h4>
         (Singing) Viktor I love you! Viktor 
         I do!</p>
      
      
      <p>Harry  joins in.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>BOYS</h4>
         When we're apart my heart beats only 
         for youuu!</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>FRED</h4>
         Sounds like the irish have got their 
         pride on.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>ARTHUR</h4>
         Stop! Stop it. It's not the irish. We've 
         gotta get out of here. Now.</p>

         <h4>ARTHUR</h4>
         Get back to the portkey everybody, and 
         stick together. Fred, George... Ginny 
         is your responsibility.</p>
      
      
      <p>Some figures in pointed hoods carrying flaming torches are walking 
         across the campsite chanting ominous noises. The crowd is paniced 
         and rushing all over. Harry  is trampled unconscious.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <h5><strong>EXT. OUTSIDE - TIME PASSED</strong></h5>
      
      
      <p>The crowds have all gone. A man walks through the rubble kicking 
         at things. He casts a spell which causes a bright flash and a 
         large ghostly skull forms in the sky with a snake crawling from 
         it. The man grins evilly, clearly demented. Harry  stirs and witnesses 
         the man standing there. Harry  runs. The familiar voices of Ron 
         and Hermione are calling for him.</p>

      <p>They look at the monstrous thing in the sky, Harry  holds his

         Loads according to Dad, that's what

      <p>Harry  has written a letter, he marks Sirius Black on an envelope

      <h5><strong>EXT. HOGWARTS</strong></h5>

         <h4>DUMBLEDORE</h4>
         Now we're all settled in and sorted, 
         I'd like to make an announcement. This 
         castle will not only be your home this 
         year but home to some very special guests 
         as well. You see Hogwarts has been choosen...</p>
      
      
      
      <p>A man runs up the aisle limping in a comical way, he whispers 
         something to Dumbledore and leaves in the same fashion.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>DUMBLEDORE</h4>
         So Hogwarts has been choosen to host 
         a legendary event. The Tri-Wizard tournament. 
         Now for those of you who do not know, 
         the tri-wizard tournament brings together 
         three schools for a series of magical 
         contests. From each school a single 
         contestant is selected to compete. Now 
         let me be clear, if choosen you stand 
         alone. And trust me when I say these 
         contests are not for the faint hearted, 
         but more of that later. For now please 
         join me in welcoming the lovely ladies 
         of the Beauxbatons Academy of magic 
         and their headmistress Madam Maxime.</p>
      
      
      
      <p>A group of girls dressed in blue dance up the aisle and release 
         butterflies into the air. They bow and everyone applauds.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>

         <h4>DUMBLEDORE</h4>
         And now our friends from the north, 
         please greet the proud sons of Durmstrang 
         and the high master Igor Karkaroff.</p>
      
      
      
      <p>A series of older boys walk up the aisle brandishing bo staffs, 
         twirling them around and periodically stabbing them into the 
         ground with a spark effect.</p>

      <p>
         <h4>DUMBLEDORE</h4>
         Not to worry Madame Maxime, our gamekeeper 
         Hagrid's more than capable of seeing 
         to them.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>MADAME MAXIME</h4>
         But you know Monsieur Hagrid, they drink 
         only single malt whiskey.</p>
      
      
      <p>The man seated next to Hagrid yelps. Hagrid has stabbed a fork

         Your attention please! I would like 
         to say a few words. Eternal glory, that 
         is what awaits the student who wins 
         the tri-wizard tournament. But to do 
         this that student must survive three 
         tasks. Three extremely dangerous tasks.</p>

         For this reason the ministry has seen 
         fit to impose a new rule. To explain 
         all this we have the head of the department 
         of international magic cooperation Mister 
         Bartimus Crouch.</p>
      
      
      <p>Thunder roars overhead, rain begins leaking through the roof 
         and screams break out. A strange man stands in the doorway, he 
         casts some magic upwards and seals the roof. Peace is restored.</p>

         He was a catcher. Half the cells in

         supposed to be mad as a hatter though 
         these days.</p>
      
      
      <p>This character enters the room and begins walking. We see Harry

         <h4>BARTY</h4>
         After much deliberation the ministry 
         has concluded that for their own safety 
         no student under the age of seventeen 
         shall be allowed to put forth their 
         name for the tri-wizard tournament. 
         This decision is final.</p>

      <p>
         <h4>DUMBLEDORE</h4>
         The goblet of fire. Anyone wishing to 
         submit themselves for the tournament 
         merely write their name upon a piece 
         of parchment and throw it in the flame 
         before this hour on Thursday night. 
         Do not do so lightly, if choosen there's 
         no turning back. As from this moment 
         the tri-wizard tournament has begun.</p>

         Ministry malcontent. And your new defence 
         against the dark arts teacher. I'm here 
         because Dumbledore asked me, end of 
         story, goodbye, the end. Any questions? 
         When it comes to the dark arts, I believe 
         in a practical approach. But first, 
         which of you can tell me how many unforgivable 
         curses there are?</p>

         <h4>MAD-EYE</h4>
         Will earn you a one way ticket to Azkaban. 
         Correct. Now the ministry says you're 
         too young to see what these curses do. 
         I say different! You need to know what 
         you're up against, you need to be prepared, 
         you need to find somewhere else to put 
         your chewing gum other than the underside 
         of your desk Mr Finnigan!</p>

         Well, my dad did tell me about one... 
         The imperious curse.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>MAD-EYE</h4>
         Ahhh yes, your father would know all 
         about that. Gave the ministry quite 
         a bit of grief a few years ago. Perhaps 
         this will show you why.</p>
      
      
      <p>Mad-Eye pops open a jar with a spider in it.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>MAD-EYE</h4>
         Hello. What a little beauty.</p>
      
      
      <p>He uses his wand to send it around the class.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>MAD-EYE</h4>
         Don't worry. Completely harmless.</p>
      
      
      <p>The class is unsettled.</p>

         But if she bites... she's lethal!</p>

         <h4>MAD-EYE</h4>
         What are you laughing at?</p>
      
      
      <p>Mad-Eye sends the spider onto Draco's face.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>MAD-EYE</h4>
         Talented isn't she? What shall I have 
         her do next? Jump out the window? Drown 
         herself?</p>
      
      
      <p>Mad-Eye has the spider over a bucket of water, it's wriggling.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>MAD-EYE</h4>
         Scores of witches and wizards have claimed 
         that they only do did you-know-whose 
         bidding under the influence of the imperious 
         curse. But here's the rub, how do we 
         sort out the liars? Another.. another.. 
         Come on come on. Longbottom is it? Up.</p>
      
      
      
      <p>Neville Longbottom stands.</p>

         <h4>NEVILLE</h4>
         There's the um... The cruciatus curse.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>MAD-EYE</h4>
         Correct! Correct! come come. Particularly 
         nasty. The torture curse.</p>
      
      
      <p>Mad-Eye begins torturing the spider with magic, it squeals.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>HERMIONE</h4>
         Stop it! Can't you see it's bothering 
         him, stop it!</p>
      
      
      <p>Mad-Eye stops. Neville is disturbed. Mad-Eye picks up the spider 
         which is still making a noise.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>MAD-EYE</h4>
         Perhaps you could give us the last unforgivable 
         curse Miss Granger.</p>
      
      
      <p>Hermione shakes her head. He casts a spell and the spider disintegrates.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>MAD-EYE</h4>
         The killing curse. Only one person is 
         known to have survived it. And he's 
         sitting in this room.</p>
      
      
      <p>He approaches Harry 's desk and takes a drink.</p>

         There's a reason those curses are unforgivable, 
         and to perform them in a classroom. 
         I mean did you see Neville's face.</p>

      <p>They jump inside the age line, and cheer. They put their names 
         in the flame and do a high-five. The flame fires up and they're 
         flung across the room onto the floor. When they get up they have 
         full heads of grey hair and beards.</p>

      <p>Dumbledore approaches the blue flame and it glows red. A name

         The champion from Beauxbatons... Fleur

      <p>People cheer, but the goblet glows red once more and another

         The hell he is. The goblet of fire is 
         an exceptionally powerful magical object, 
         only an exceptionally powerful conjurer

         I'm Rita Skeeter, I write for the daily 
         prophet. But of course you know that 
         don't you. It's you we don't know, you're 
         the news. What quirks lurk beneath those 
         rosy cheeks? what mysteries do the muscles 
         mask? does courage lie beneath those 
         curls? In short, what makes a champion 
         tick. Me, myself and I want to know. 
         Not to mention my rabid readers. So, 
         who's feeling up to sharing? Mmm? Shall 
         we start with the youngest. Lovely.</p>

         feel? proud? or concerned that your

         I don't have much time Harry  so let

         Shh... I had to ask. Now, tell me about 
         this dream of yours. You mentioned Wormtail 
         and Voldemort, but who was the third 
         man in the room?</p>

         No. Umm.. Voldemort was giving him a

         <h4>HARRY</h4>
         He wanted... me. I dunno why, but he

         I mean it was only a dream right?</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>SIR</h4>
         Yes. It's just a dream. Look Harry , 
         the deatheaters at the world cup, your 
         name rising from that goblet these are 
         not just coincidences. Hogwarts isn't 
         safe any more.</p>

      <p>
         <h4>SIR</h4>
         I'm saying the devils are inside the 
         walls. Igor Karkaroff, he was a deatheater. 
         And no one, no one stops being a deatheater. 
         Then there's Barty Crouch, heart of 
         stone, sent his OWN son to Azkaban.</p>

      <p>
         <h4>SIR</h4>
         I haven't a clue who put your name in 
         that goblet Harry  but whoever did it 
         is no friend to you. People die in this 
         tournament.</p>

         Come on Harry . They're seriously misunderstood 
         creatures.</p>
      
      
      <p>A huge flame fires up.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>HAGRID</h4>
         Although, I have to admit that horntail 
         is a right nasty piece of work. Poor 
         Ron nearly fainted just seeing him you 
         know.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>HARRY</h4>
         Ron was here?</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>HAGRID</h4>
         Oh sure. His brother Charlie helped 
         bring him over from Romania. Didn't 
         Ron tell you that?</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>HARRY</h4>
         No he didn't. He didn't tell me a thing.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <h5><strong>EXT. HOGWARTS - DAYTIME</strong></h5>
      
      
      <p>We're zoomed in on a badge, it depicts Cedric on a bright yellow 
         background. Then the badge spins and shows Harry  on a green background 
         with the words " Potter  Stinks" on it. As Harry  walks along other 
         pupils aim insults at him saying he stinks. A young boy runs 
         past.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>BOY</h4>
         Cedric rules!</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>HARRY</h4>
         Thanks.</p>
      
      
      <p>Harry  gets to a doorway, two pupils stand in his way.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>BOY</h4>
         Like the badge?</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>HARRY</h4>
         Excuse me..</p>
      
      
      <p>They laugh, Harry  pushes his way through. He approaches Cedric 
         who is standing around with his friends. Cedric's friends hurl 
         off more insults.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>HARRY</h4>
         (to Cedric) Can I have a word?</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>CEDRIC</h4>
         Alright.</p>
      
      
      <p>They walk away some distance.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>HARRY</h4>
         Dragons. That's the first task. They've 
         got one for each of us.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>CEDRIC</h4>
         Are you serious? And Fleur and Krum, 
         do they...?</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>HARRY</h4>
         Yes.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>CEDRIC</h4>
         Right. Hey listen, about the badges. 
         I've asked them not to wear them.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>HARRY</h4>
         Don't worry about it.</p>
      
      
      <p>Ron and Seamus are walking along. Harry  approaches them.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>HARRY</h4>
         (To Ron) You're a right foul git you

      <p>
         <h4>HARRY</h4>
         Yeah. Stay away from me.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>RON</h4>
         Fine.</p>
      
      
      
      <p>Draco calls out, he's sitting up a tree.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>DRACO</h4>
         Why so tense Potter? My father and I 
         have a bet you see. I don't think you're 
         gonna last ten minutes in this tournament. 
         He disagrees. He thinks you won't last 
         FIVE.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>HARRY</h4>
         I don't give a damn what you or your 
         father thinks Malfoy. He's vile and 
         cruel, and you're just pathetic.</p>
      
      
      <p>Harry  walks away and Draco angrily tries casting a spell. Mad-Eye 
         appears and quickly turns Malfoy into a ferret.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>MAD-EYE</h4>
         I'll teach you to cast when someone's 
         back is turned.</p>

         Is that a student?</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>MAD-EYE</h4>
         Technically it's a ferret.</p>
      
      
      <p>Mad-Eye is making the ferret hover around. He sends it up the 
         trouser leg of one of Draco's friends. He squirms and looks uncomfortable. 
         Everyone else is laughing. Mad-Eye winks to Harry  and he laughs. 
         Eventually it comes back out and McGonagall turns Draco back 
         to normal.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>DRACO</h4>
         My father will hear about this!</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>MAD-EYE</h4>
         Is that a threat!</p>
      
      
      <p>Draco runs away. Mad-Eye shouts after him.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>MAD-EYE</h4>
         I could tell you stories about your 
         father that would curl even your greasy 
         hair boy! It doesn't end here!</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>MCGONAGALL</h4>
         We never use transfigration as a punishment, 
         surely Dumbledore told you that.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>MAD-EYE</h4>
         He might've mentioned it.</p>

         That's a foal glass. Lets me keep an 
         eye on my enemies. If I can see the 
         whites of their eyes they're standing 
         right behind me.</p>
      
      
      <p>A noise emerges from a trunk on the floor and it shakes.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>MAD-EYE</h4>
         Wouldn't even bother telling you what's 
         in ther. You wouldn't believe it if 
         I did. Now... what are you going to 
         do about your dragon?</p>

         <h4>MAD-EYE</h4>
         Sit. Listen to me Potter. Your pal Diggory, 
         by your age he could take a whistle 
         into a watch and have it sing you the 
         time. Miss Delacour, she's as much a 
         fairy princess as I am. As for Krum, 
         his head may be filled with sawdust 
         but Karkaroff's is NOT. They'll have 
         a strategy, and you can bet that it'll 
         play to Krum's strengths. Hmm? Come 
         on Potter. What are your strengths?</p>

         (VOICEOVER THE LOUDSPEAKER) Three of

         and so each one of them will proceed 
         to the next task. And now our fourth 
         and final contestant.</p>
      
      
      <p>Harry  enters the rocky arena. The crowd are cheering his name. 
         He sees the golden egg sitting alone, he makes a run for it but 
         the dragon appears. Harry 's forced to retreat behind a rock as 
         the dragon flames him. Harry  stumbles and falls around the arena.</p>

         gives chase. The dragon bursts through the crowd and they look 
         stunned.</p>

      <p>Harry  is flying at high speed around the Hogwarts buildings. 
         The dragon cuts him off and whips him off his broom, he lands 
         on the roof of Hogwarts, hanging on for dear life. The dragon 
         is clambering across the roof, strewing tiles as it goes. Harry  
         reaches his broom but it's stuck. He jerks it loose and lets 
         go of the roof just in time before the dragon swipes at him. 
         He falls a long way but regains control. He flies on to an area 
         with a bridge, he flies through a gap in the bridge but the dragon 
         crashes into it and falls into the water.</p>

         He just asked Fleur Delacour out.</p>

         <h4>HERMIONE</h4>
         What?</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>HARRY</h4>
         What did she say?</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>HERMIONE</h4>
         No of course.</p>
      
      
      <p>Ron shakes his head. </p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>HERMIONE</h4>
         She said yes??</p>

         Don't be silly.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>RON</h4>
         There she was walking by. You know I 
         like it when they walk. I couldn't help 
         it, it just sort of slipped out.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>GIRL</h4>
         Actually he sort of screamed at her, 
         it was a bit frightening.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>HARRY</h4>
         What did you do then?</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>RON</h4>
         What else? I ran for it. I'm not cut 
         out for this Harry . I don't know what 
         got into me.</p>
      
      
      <p>The Patil twins walk past.</p>

      <p>ELSEWHERE</p>
      
      
      <p>Ron is getting dressed in front of a mirror. He looks paniced 
         and uncomfortable in his ridiculous dress robes.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>RON</h4>
         Bloody hell.</p>
      
      
      <p>Harry  walks in, he's dressed in a more conventional suit.</p>

         Well they're alright. No lace, no dodgy

         Traditional?? They're ancient! I look

      <h5><strong>INT. DANCEHALL</strong></h5>
      
      
      <p>Harry  and Ron are walking down the stairs into the hall. Ron 
         is fidgeting with his outfit.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>HARRY</h4>
         Leave it alone.</p>

         Poor kid, bet she's alone in her room

      <p>
         <h4>HARRY</h4>

      <p>
         <h4>RON</h4>
         Hermione of course. Come on Harry , why'd 
         you think she wouldn't tell us who she's 
         coming with?</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>HARRY</h4>
         Because we'd take the mickey out of 
         her if she did.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>RON</h4>
         Because nobody asked her. I would have 
         taken her myself if she weren't so bleeding 
         proud.</p>
      
      
      <p>The boys approach the Patil twins.</p>

         Hello boys. Don't you look...</p>

         <h4>PARVATI</h4>

         Ready professor?</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>MCGONAGALL</h4>
         To dance. It's traditional that the 
         three champions or in this case four 
         are the first to dance. Surely I told 
         you that.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>HARRY</h4>
         No.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>MCGONAGALL</h4>
         Oh well now you know. Oh, as for your 
         Mr Weasley you may proceed into the great 
         hall with Miss Patil.</p>
      
      
      <p>Hermione enters the room all dressed up.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>PARVATI</h4>
         She looks beautiful.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>HARRY</h4>
         Yeah she does.</p>
      
      
      <p>Hermione walks down the stairs. Viktor Krum takes her hand and 
         they walk together.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>PADMA</h4>
         (To Ron) Is that Hermione Granger? With 
         Viktor Krum??</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>RON</h4>
         No. Absolutely not.</p>
      
      
      <p>Loud music plays as the champions head to the dancefloor with 
         their partners.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>PARVATI</h4>
         Harry . Take my waist.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>HARRY</h4>
         What?</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>PARVATI</h4>
         Now.</p>
      
      
      <p>They dance. Soon others are joining in, Dumbledore and McGonagall, 
         Mr Filch and his cat, Hagrid and Madame Maxime. Mad-Eye sits 
         on the sidelines drinking. The scene changes, the music is now 
         rock played by the Weird Sisters fronted by Jarvis Cocker from 
         Pulp. Cool!. The crowd is jumping. Harry , Ron and their dates 
         are sitting some distance away looking miserable. Hermione comes 
         up after a great time with Viktor.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>HERMIONE</h4>
         Hot isn't it? Viktor's gone to get drinks. 
         Care to join us?</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>RON</h4>
         No, we'd NOT care to join you and Viktor.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>HERMIONE</h4>
         What's got your wand in a knot?</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>RON</h4>
         He's a Durmstrang. You're fraternising 
         with the enemy.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>HERMIONE</h4>
         The enemy?? Who was it wanting his autograph? 
         Besides, the whole point of the tournament 
         is international magical cooperation, 
         to make friends.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>RON</h4>
         Hrmph, I think he's got a bit more than 
         friendship on his mind.</p>
      
      
      <p>Hermione walks off.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>PADMA</h4>
         Are you going to ask me to dance or 
         not?</p>

      <p>
         <h4>HERMIONE</h4>
         How dare you! Besides I can take care 
         of myself.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>RON</h4>
         Doubt it. He's way too old.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>HERMIONE</h4>
         What? What? That's what you think?</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>RON</h4>
         Yeah that is what I think.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>

         You know the solution then don't you.</p>

      <p>
         <h4>HERMIONE</h4>
         Next time there's a ball pluck up the 
         courage and ask me before somebody else 
         does, and not as a last resort.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>RON</h4>
         Well that's completely off the point. 
         Harry ...</p>
      
      
      <p>Harry  walks up.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>HERMIONE</h4>
         Where have you been? Nevermind! Off 
         to bed both of you.</p>
      
      
      <p>Harry  and Ron walk away.</p>

         They get scary when they get older.</p>

         <h4>VOLDERMORT</h4>
         Let me see it again.</p>
      
      
      <p>A sleeve is rolled up and a marking of a skull and snake in on 
         the arm.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>VOLDEMORT</h4>
         Ah yes, the time is close now. Harry ! 
         At last! Step aside Wormtail so I can 
         give our guest a proper greeting!</p>
      
      
      
      <p>Harry  wakes up. The floorboards are creaking, someone is walking 
         up to his bed. It's Neville.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>NEVILLE</h4>
         You alright Harry ? I just got in. Me!</p>
      
      
      
      <p>He chuckles and dances off.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <h5><strong>EXT. A BRIDGE OUTSIDE HOGWARTS</strong></h5>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>HERMIONE</h4>
         Harry  you told me you'd figured the 
         egg out weeks ago. The task is two days 
         from now.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>HARRY</h4>
         Really? I had no idea. I suppose Viktor's 
         already figured it out.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>HERMIONE</h4>
         I wouldn't know, we didn't actually 
         talk about the tournament. Actually 
         we didn't really talk at all, Viktor's 
         more of a physical being. I just mean 
         he's not particularly... Mostly he watches 
         me study. It's a bit annoying actually. 
         You are trying to figure this egg out 
         aren't you?</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>HARRY</h4>
         What's that supposed to mean?</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>HERMIONE</h4>
         I mean these tasks are supposed to test 
         you, in the most brutal way they're 
         almost cruel. And um, I'm scared for 
         you. You got by the dragon mostly on 
         nerve, I'm not sure it's going to be 
         enough this time.</p>

         Look I realise I never really thanked

         those dragons.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>HARRY</h4>
         Forget about it. I'm sure you would 
         have done the same for me.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>CEDRIC</h4>
         Exactly. You know the prefects bathroom 
         on the fifth floor?</p>
      
      
      <p>Harry  nods.</p>

         <h4>CEDRIC</h4>
         It's not a bad place for a bath. Just 
         take your egg and mull things over in

         <h4>HARRY</h4>
         I must be out of my mind.</p>
      
      
      <p>He opens the egg and the horrible screech noise comes out.</p>

         I'd try putting it in the water if I

      <p>
         <h4>MYRTLE</h4>
         I was circling a blocked drain the other 
         day and could swear I saw a bit of polyjuice 
         potion. Not being a bad boy again are 
         you Harry ?</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>HARRY</h4>
         Polyjuice potion! Kicked the habit. 
         Myrtle, did you say try putting it in 
         the water?</p>
      
      
      <p>Myrtle flies around again and gets in the water.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>MYRTLE</h4>
         Well. That's what he did. The other 
         boy, the handsome one. Cedric.</p>
      
      
      <p>Harry  takes the egg and puts it under the water.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>MYRTLE</h4>
         Well go on, open it.</p>
      
      
      <p>Harry  does so and goes underwater himself. He hears a voice singing.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>VOICE SINGING</h4>
         Come seek us where our voices sound. 
         We cannot sing above the ground. An 
         hour long you'll have to look, to recover 
         what we took.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>HARRY</h4>
         Myrtle, there aren't Merpeople in the 
         black lake are there?</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>MYRTLE</h4>
         Ahhh, very good. Took Cedric ages to 
         riddle it out. Almost all the bubbles 
         were gone...</p>
      
      
      <p>Myrtle laughs and Harry  is embarrassed.</p>

         Neville. No offense, but I really don't 
         care about plants. Now if there's a 
         Tibetan turnip that will allow me to

         <h4>DUMBLEDORE</h4>
         (Over a loudspeaker) Welcome to the 
         second task. Last night something was 
         stolen from each of our champions. A 
         treasure of sorts. These four treasures, 
         one for each champion, now lie on the 
         bottom of the black lake. In order to 
         win each champion need only find their 
         treasure and return to the surface. 
         Simple enough. Except for this, they 
         will have one hour to do so and one 
         hour only. After that they'll be on 
         their own.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>MAD-EYE</h4>
         (To Harry) Put that in your mouth.</p>
      
      
      
      <p>Harry puts the gilliweed in his mouth and starts choking.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>DUMBLEDORE</h4>
         (Continued) You may begin at the start 
         of the cannon.</p>
      
      
      <p>The cannon fires and the champions enter the water, three of 
         them dive in while Harry is pushed. Underwater the effects of 
         gilliweed take hold, Harry's hands and feet become webbed. </p>

         (Over the loudspeaker) The Beauxbatons 
         champion Miss Delacour has unfortunately 
         been forced to retire. She will take 
         no further part in this task.</p>

      <p>Harry  is still searching around. He hears muffled screams. He 
         finds Ron, Hermione, Cho Chang and a blonde girl from Beauxbatons 
         tied in place by their ankles. Cedric is there, he takes Cho 
         with him. Harry  sets about freeing Ron and Hermione but vicious 
         merpeople appear.</p>

         Only one.</p>
      
      
      <p>What looks like a shark approaches at high speed. We see that 
         it has legs and it's Viktor. He takes Hermione and heads for 
         the surface. Harry  frees Ron. </p>
      
      
      
      
      <h5><strong>EXT. ABOVE WATER</strong></h5>
      
      
      <p>Cedric and Cho emerge, the crowd cheers. Viktor and Hermione 
         next, the crows chants 'Krum, Krum, Krum'. The Beauxbatons girls 
         look worried.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <h5><strong>EXT. UNDERWATER</strong></h5>
      
      
      <p>Harry  looks over and sees the blonde girl that Fleur was unable 
         to rescue. He loosens her rope too and starts heading for the 
         surface with the both of them. He's attacked and gets held down, 
         he pushes Ron and the girl towards the surface.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <h5><strong>EXT. ABOVE WATER</strong></h5>
      
      
      <p>Ron and the girl come up, they are coughing but safe. They're 
         helped out of the water by a girl from Beauxbatons. Underwater 
         Harry  casts a spell which propels him towards the surface, he 
         flies out and lands on the decking where the crowd are.</p>

         Tragic of course, to lose one's family. 
         Never whole again are we? Still, life 
         goes on. And here we stand. I'm sure

         <h4>DUMBLEDORE</h4>
         A man has died here. And he won't be 
         the last, you must take action.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>FUDGE</h4>
         I will not. In times like these the 
         wizard world looks to its leaders for 
         strength Dumbledore.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>DUMBLEDORE</h4>
         Then for once show them some.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>FUDGE</h4>
         The tri-wizard tournament will not be 
         cancelled. I will not be seen as a coward.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>DUMBLEDORE</h4>
         But surely that is what's right, no 
         matter what others think.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>FUDGE</h4>
         What did you say? What did you say to 
         me?</p>

         <h4>MAD-EYE</h4>
         Excuse me gentlemen, it may interest 
         you to know that this conversation is 
         no longer private.</p>
      
      
      <p>Mad-Eye points to the door. Harry  enters.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>FUDGE</h4>
         Harry ! Harry  how good to see you again.</p>

         <h4>HARRY</h4>
         I can come back later Professor.</p>

         <h4>DUMBLEDORE</h4>
         Oh not necessary Harry  the minister 
         and I are done. I'll be back in a moment. 
         Minister, after you. Harry  do feel free 
         to indulge in a liquorice snack in my 
         absence, but I have to warn you they're 
         a little bit sharp.</p>
      
      
      <p>Harry  is left alone in the room. He puts his hand in the snackbowl 
         and takes a handful. It turns into a small creature which nips 
         at his hand.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>HARRY</h4>
         Agh!</p>
      
      
      <p>A compartment in the wall opens, there's a glowing blue pool 
         of water there. He looks in. He falls and lands in another time 
         and place. It's a courtroom, the walls have a red glow. Dumbledore 
         is seated next to where Harry  is.</p>

         <h4>MAN</h4>
         Professor.</p>
      
      
      <p>Dumbledore and the man shake hands. Their handshake goes through 
         Harry 's body, he appears to be some kind of ghost with no presence. 
         Proceedings begin, a cage is raised from inside the floor.</p>

         <h4>BARTY</h4>
         Igor Karkaroff, you have been brought 
         from Azkaban at your own request to 
         present evidence to this counsel. Should 
         your testimony prove consequential. 
         Counsel may be prepared to order your 
         immediate release. Until such time you 
         remain in the eyes of the ministry a 
         convicted deatheater. Do you accept 
         these terms?</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>IGOR</h4>

         <h4>IGOR</h4>
         I have names sir. There was a Rosier, 
         Evan Rosier.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>BARTY</h4>
         Mr Rosier is dead.</p>

      <p>Mad-Eye points to his mechanical eye.</p>

         I didn't know.</p>

         <h4>BARTY</h4>
         If that is all the witness has to offer...</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>IGOR</h4>
         No! No! There was Rookwood, he was a 
         spy.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>BARTY</h4>
         Augustus Rookwood? Of the department 
         of ministries.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>IGOR</h4>
         Ya ya, the same. He passed information 
         to you know who from inside the ministry 
         itself.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>BARTY</h4>
         Very well. Counsel will deliberate. 
         In the meantime you will be returned 
         to Azkaban.</p>

         Severus Snape.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>DUMBLEDORE</h4>
         The counsel is very much aware you have 
         given evidence on this matter. Severus 
         Snape was indeed a deatheater and prior 
         to Lord Voldemort's downfall turned 
         spy for us at great personal risk. Today 
         he's no more a deatheater than I am.</p>
      
      
      
      <p>Igor protests loudly.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>IGOR</h4>
         It's a lie! Severus Snape remains faithful 
         to the dark lord.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>BARTY</h4>

         <h4>BARTY</h4>
         Unless the witness possesses any name 
         of genuine consequence this session 
         is now concluded.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>IGOR</h4>
         Oh no no no no no. I heard about one

         Barty Crouch! ... Junior.</p>
      
      
      <p>Barty Crouch junior begins to run. Mad-Eye zaps him with magic, 
         he falls into the center of the court. The crowd is in uproar. 
         Guards seize Barty junior.</p>

      <p>
         <h4>DUMBLEDORE</h4>
         Curiosity's not a sin Harry , but you 
         should exercise caution. It's a pensieve, 
         useful if like me you find your mind 
         a wee bit stretched. It allows me to 
         see what small things I've already seen. 
         You see Harry  I've searched and searched 
         for something, some small detail. Something 
         I might have overlooked, something that 
         would explain why these terrible things 
         have happened. Every time I get close 
         to an answer it slips away, it's maddedning.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>HARRY</h4>
         Sir, Mr Crouch's son, what happened 
         to him?</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>DUMBLEDORE</h4>
         He was sent to Azkaban. Destroyed Barty 
         to do it. But he had no choice, the 
         evidence was overwhelming. Why do you 
         ask?</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>HARRY</h4>
         It's just that I had a dream about him. 
         It was in the summer, before school. 
         In the dream I was in a house and Voldemort 
         was there only he wasn't quite human, 
         and Wormtail was there too and Mr Crouch's 
         son.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>DUMBLEDORE</h4>
         Have there been other dreams like this?</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>HARRY</h4>
         Yes. Always the same one. Sir... these 
         dreams, what I see, you don't think 
         it's actually happening do you?</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>DUMBLEDORE</h4>
         I think it's unwise for you to linger 
         over these dreams Harry , I think it's 
         best that you simply...</p>

         Ingenious. A rather rare herb gilliweed, 
         not something found in your every day 
         garden. Nor is this, know what it is?</p>

         <h4>SEVERUS</h4>
         Veritaserum. Three drops of this and 
         you-know-who himself will spill his 
         darkest secrets. The use of this on 
         a student is regrettably forbidden, 
         however should you ever steal from my 
         personal stores again, my hand might 
         just slip over your morning pumpkin 
         juice.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>HARRY</h4>
         I haven't stolen anything.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>SEVERUS</h4>
         Don't lie to me. Gilliweed might be 
         innocuous, but boomslang skin? lacewing 
         flies? You and your friends are brewing 
         polyjuice potion and believe me I'm 
         going to find out why.</p>

         <h4>DUMBLEDORE</h4>
         Earlier today Professor Moody placed 
         the tri-wizards cup deep within the 
         maze. Only he knows its exact position. 
         Now as Mr Diggory...</p>

         (continued) and Mr Potter tied for first 
         position they will be the first to enter 
         the maze. Followed by Mr Krum...</p>
      
      
      <p>The bulgarian crowd go nuts.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>DUMBLEDORE</h4>
         (continued) The first person to touch 
         the cup will be the winner. I've instructed 
         the staff to patrol the perimeter, if 
         at any point should a contestant wish 
         to withdraw from the task he or she 
         need only send up red sparks with their 
         wands. Contestants, gather round.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>DUMBLEDORE</h4>
         (To the contestants) In the maze you'll 
         find not dragons or creatures of the 
         deep. Instead you'll face something 
         more challenging. You see, people change 
         in the maze. Oh find the cup if you 
         can, but be very weary you could just 
         lose yourselves along the way.</p>

      <p>The cannon goes off. Mr Filch shrugs comically. Dumbledore groans. 
         Harry  and Cedric enter the maze through different entrances. 
         The entrance closes up behind Harry . Heavy mist sets in, we pan 
         out to see the maze is many stories tall. Harry  starts traversing 
         the maze, creature noises are all around.</p>
      
      
      <p>Cedric is walking along, the maze walls begin to close in on 
         him. He makes a run for it. Fleur is running around scared, she 
         is attacked and knocked down. Viktor comes along and sees she's 
         unconscious on the ground, he walks on. Harry  sees Fleur being 
         swallowed into the undergrowth.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>HARRY</h4>
         Fleur? Fleur!</p>
      
      
      <p>He's too late she's disappeared. He sends up a red spark into 
         the air. A heavy wind starts blowing, walls are closing in, Harry  
         runs. Harry  sees something shining in the distance and he moves 
         towards it Viktor tries to zap him but misses.</p>

      <p>Harry  ducks and Viktor gets zapped by Cedric. Cedric runs up 
         and kicks the wand out of Viktor's hand. He points his wand at 
         Viktor's body as if to finish him off, Harry  runs up and intervenes.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>HARRY</h4>
         No stop! He's bewitched Cedric.</p>
      
      
      <p>They struggle.</p>

         <h4>HARRY</h4>
         He's bewitched!</p>
      
      
      <p>The two of them begin running towards the cup. The undergrowth 
         grabs Cedric and he falls to the ground. Harry  looks back. Cedric 
         is pinned down with no means of escape.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>CEDRIC</h4>
         Harry ! Harry !</p>
      
      
      <p>Harry  zaps the plantlife and Cedric wriggles free. Harry  helps 
         him up.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>CEDRIC</h4>

      <p>Wormtail casts a spell and kills Cedric.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>HARRY</h4>
         Cedric!</p>
      
      
      <p>Cedric lays dead on the ground.</p>
      
      
      <p>Wormtail pulls Harry  closer, a status grabs hold of Harry  and 
         traps him.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>VOLDEMORT</h4>
         Do it, now!</p>
      
      
      <p>Wormtail drops something into a cauldron, Harry  watches on. </p>
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>WORMTAIL</h4>
         Bones of the father, unwillingly given.</p>
      
      
      
      <p>A bone hovers in the air under Wormtail's control, he drops it 
         into the cauldron.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>WORMTAIL</h4>
         Flesh of the servent willingly sacrificed.</p>
      
      
      
      <p>He takes a knife and slashes his arm over the cauldron.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>WORMTAIL</h4>
         Blood of the enemy forcibly taken.</p>
      
      
      
      <p>He takes the knife to Harry  and cuts at his arm. Harry  shouts. 
         Wormtail takes the knife over to the cauldron and lets the drops 
         fall into it.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>WORMTAIL</h4>
         The dark lord shall rise again.</p>
      
      
      <p>The cauldron bursts into flame and a reformed Voldemort emerges.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>VOLDEMORT</h4>

      <p>Wormtail hands him the wand and bows deeply.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>VOLDEMORT</h4>
         Hold out your arm.</p>

         <h4>VOLDEMORT</h4>
         The other arm Wormtail.</p>
      
      
      <p>Wormtail looks concerned, but does it anyway. Voldemort sticks 
         the wand into Wormtail's arm. The sky changes, others have been 
         summoned.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>VOLDEMORT</h4>
         Welcome my friends. Thirty years it's 
         been, and yet you stand before me as 
         though it were only yesterday. I confess 
         myself disappointed, not one of you 
         tried to find me.</p>
      
      
      <p>Voldemort begins slashing angrily at the hooded figures. </p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>VOLDEMORT</h4>

      <p>
         <h4>LUCIUS</h4>
         My lord. Had I detected any sign or 
         even a whisper of your whereabouts.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>VOLDEMORT</h4>
         There were signs my friend, and more 
         than whispers.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>LUCIUS</h4>
         I assure you I never renounced the old 
         ways. The face I have been obliged to 
         present each day since your absence, 
         that was my true mask.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>WORMTAIL</h4>
         I returned.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>VOLDEMORT</h4>
         Out of fear, not loyalty. Still you 
         have proved yourself useful these past 
         few months Wormtail.</p>
      
      
      <p>Voldemort grants Wormtail a new hand.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>WORMTAIL</h4>
         Thank you master, thank you.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>VOLDEMORT</h4>
         (To Cedric's corpse) Oh, such a handsome 
         boy.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>HARRY</h4>
         Don't touch him.</p>
      
      
      <p>Harry struggles to get free.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>VOLDEMORT</h4>
         Harry ! I'd almost forgotten you were 
         here. Standing on the bones of my father. 
         I'd introduce you but word has it you're 
         almost as famous as me these days. The 
         boy who lived. How lies have fed your 
         legend Harry . Shall I reveal what really 
         happened that night thirteen years ago? 
         Shall I divulge how I truly lost my 
         powers? It was love. You see when dear 
         sweet Lily Potter  gave her life for 
         her only son she provided the ultimate 
         protection. I could not touch you. It 
         was old magic, something I should have 
         forseen. But no matter, no matter. Things 
         have changed, I can touch you now!</p>
      
      
      
      <p>Voldemort puts his hand on Harry's head and he screams.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>VOLDEMORT</h4>
         Astonishing what a few drops of your 
         blood will do eh Harry ? Pick up your 
         wand Potter. I said pick it up, get 
         up. Get up! You've been taught how to 
         duel I presume yes? First we bow to 
         each other. Come on now Harry  the niceties 
         must be observed, Dumbledore would not 
         want you to forget your manners now 
         would he? I said bow!</p>
      
      
      <p>Voldemort forces Harry  to bow with magic.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>VOLDEMORT</h4>
         That's better. And now...</p>
      
      
      <p>Voldemort casts at Harry  and he wriggles in pain.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>VOLDEMORT</h4>
         Atta boy Harry , your parents would be 
         proud. Especially your filthy mongrel 
         mother. I'm going to kill you Harry  
         Potter, I'm going to destroy you. After 
         tonight no one will ever again question 
         my powers. After tonight if they speak 
         of you they'll speak only of how you 
         begged for death, and I being a merciful 
         lord obliged. Get up.</p>
      
      
      <p>Voldemort pulls Harry  to his feet, Harry  begins to move away.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>VOLDEMORT</h4>
         Don't you turn your back on me Harry  
         Potter  I want you to look at me when 
         I kill you, I want to see the lights 
         leave your eyes.</p>
      
      
      <p>Harry  takes steps toward Voldemort.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>HARRY</h4>
         Have it your way.</p>
      
      
      <p>They both cast and their streams of magic meet. They both struggle.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>VOLDEMORT</h4>
         Do nothing. He is mine to finish. He's 
         mine!</p>
      
      
      <p>Shapes form in the surrounding magical energy. We hear Dumbledore's 
         voice.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>HARRY</h4>'S DAD

         broken you must get to the portkey. 
         We can delay it for a moment to give 
         you time but only a moment, do you understand?</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>CEDRIC</h4>
         (voice) Harry  take my body back will 
         you? Take my body back to my father.</p>

         <h4>HARRY</h4>'S MOTHER
         (voice) Let go. Sweetheart you're ready. 
         Let go! Let go!</p>
      
      
      <p>The connection breaks, Harry  runs over to Cedric's body and summons 
         the cup over to them. In an instant the port out. Voldemort looks 
         angry.</p>

      <p>Back at the arena Harry  appears with Cedric's body. The crowd 
         don't understand what has taken place and they all cheer, triumphant 
         music starts to play. Harry  weeps on Cedric's body. </p>

         He's back, he's back! Voldemort's back. 
         Cedric, he asked me to bring his body 
         back. I couldn't leave him, not there.</p>

      <p>
         <h4>HARRY</h4>
         The cup was a portkey. Someone had bewitched

      <p>
         <h4>HARRY</h4>
         I dunno. It was like I'd fallen into 
         one of my dreams. One of my nightmares.</p>
      
      
      
      <p>Mad-Eye starts shaking and struggling for air, he reaches for 
         his bottle but it's empty. He rushes to a chest with other bottles 
         and struggles to find one.</p>

         Were there others? In the graveyard, 
         were there others?</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>HARRY</h4>
         Um. I don't think I said anything about 
         a graveyard Professor.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>MAD-EYE</h4>
         Marvellous creatures dragons aren't 
         they? Do you think that miserable oaf 
         would have led you into the woods if 
         I hadn't suggested it? Do you think 
         Cedric Diggory would have told you to 
         hold the egg under the water if I hadn't 
         have told him first myself? Do you think 
         Neville Longbottom the witless wonder 
         could have provided you with gilliweed 
         if I hadn't have given him the book 
         that led you straight to it? Huh??</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>HARRY</h4>
         It was you from the beginning. You put 
         my name in the goblet of fire. You bewitched 
         Krum. But...</p>
      
      
      <p>Mad-Eye makes sobbing noises making fun of Harry .</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>MAD-EYE</h4>
         You won because I made it so Potter. 
         You ended up in that graveyard tonight 
         because it was meant to be so. And now 
         the deed is done. The blood that runs 
         through these veins runs within the 
         dark lord. Imagine how he will reward 
         me when he learns that I have once and 
         for all silenced the great  Harry Potter .</p>
      
      
      
      <p>A flash of magic occurs and Mad-Eye is knocked into the wall. 
         Dumbledore and Severus come rushing in. Dumbledore takes Mad-Eye 
         by the neck...</p>

         <h4>DUMBLEDORE</h4>
         Severus...</p>
      
      
      <p>Severus administers some veritaserum. Mad-Eye wriggles demonically.</p>

         Is he in this room? Is he in this room?</p>
      
      
      
      <p>We see a nod.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>DUMBLEDORE</h4>
         Harry  get away from there!</p>
      
      
      <p>Dumbledore approaches the chest. The chest opens, it contains 
         a series of smaller chests. When the final chest is open we see 
         that there's a pit within holding a man the real Alastor Moody.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>DUMBLEDORE</h4>
         Are you alright Alastor?</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>ALASTOR</h4>
         I'm sorry Albus.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>HARRY</h4>
         That's Moody, but then who's...?</p>
      
      
      <p>Dumbledore holds up one of Mad-Eye's Bottles.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>SEVERUS</h4>

      <p>
         <h4>DUMBLEDORE</h4>
         Now we know who's been stealing it from 
         your store Severus.</p>
      
      
      <p>Dumbledore looks into the pit.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>DUMBLEDORE</h4>
         We'll get you up in a minute.</p>
      
      
      <p>Alastor Moody groans. The Mad-Eye Moody they have captive in 
         a chair begins to twitch about restlessly making strange noises. 
         He appears to be transforming. He rips off his fake eyepiece 
         which falls on the floor, we see that he's transformed into Barty 
         Crouch Junior.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>DUMBLEDORE</h4>

         I'll show you mine if you show me yours.</p>
      
      
      
      <p>Barty Jr rolls up his sleeve to reveal a skull and snake marking.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>DUMBLEDORE</h4>

      <p>
         <h4>BARTY JR</h4>
         You know what this means don't you? 
         He's back. Lord Voldemort has returned.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>DUMBLEDORE</h4>
         Send an owl to Azkaban, think they'll 
         find they're missing a prisoner.</p>
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>BARTY JR</h4>
         I'll be welcomed back like a hero.</p>

         <h4>DUMBLEDORE</h4>
         Perhaps. Personally I've never had much 
         time for heroes.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <h5><strong>INT. ASSEMBLY ROOM</strong></h5>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>DUMBLEDORE</h4>
         (Speaking to all pupils) Today we acknowledge 
         a really terrible loss. Cedric Diggory 
         was as you all know, exceptionally hard 
         working, intricately fair minded. And 
         most importantly a fierce fierce friend. 
         I think therefore you have the right 
         to know exactly how he died. You see, 
         Cedric Diggory was murdered by Lord 
         Voldemort. The ministry of magic does 
         not wish me to tell you this. But not 
         to do so I think would be an insult 
         to his memory. Now the pain we all feel 
         at this dreadful loss reminds me, reminds 
         us that while we may come from different 
         places and speak in different tongues, 
         our hearts beat as one. In light of 
         recent events the bonds of friendship 
         we made this year will be more important 
         than ever. Remember that and Cedric 
         Diggory will not have died in vain, 
         you remember that. And we'll celebrate 
         a boy who was kind and honest and brave 
         and true right to the very end.</p>

      <p>Harry  is sitting on a bed, Dumbledore walks in.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>DUMBLEDORE</h4>
         I never liked these curtains. Set them 
         on fire in my fourth year, by accident 
         of course. I put you in terrible danger 
         this year Harry  I'm sorry.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>HARRY</h4>
         Professor, when I was in the graveyard 
         there was a moment... um... when Voldemort's 
         wand and mine sort of connected.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>DUMBLEDORE</h4>
         Priorium Contatum. You saw your parents 
         that night didn't you? They reappeared.</p>
      
      
      
      <p>Harry  nods.</p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>
         <h4>DUMBLEDORE</h4>
         No spell can reawaken the dead Harry  
         I trust you know that. Dark and diffiult 
         times lie ahead. Soon we must all face 
         the choice between what is right what 
         is easy. But remember this, you have 
         friends here. You're not alone.</p>

         Do you think we'll ever just have a

         Yes.</p>

         Promise you'll write this summer. Both 
         of you.</p>

         <h4>HERMIONE</h4>
         Harry  will won't you?</p>

         <h4>HARRY</h4>
         Yeah. Every week.</p>
      
      
      <p>They look over the balcony, the flying horses pulling a carriage 
         head off into the distance. The Bulgarians' ship goes underwater.</p>
      
      FADE OUT.
