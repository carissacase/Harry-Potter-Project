               TITLES<setting>INT. DARK ROOM - NIGHT TIME</setting>

               An old man lights a gas oven with a match, he is preparing food. 
               He notices a light on in the large house opposite, he stops what 
               he's doing and walks to the door.

                         Bloody kids.

               He leaves the house and heads towards the light.

               The old man is wandering up to the house carrying a lit torch. 
               He opens the front door, inside is just as dark. He begins climbing 
               the stairs, we hear whispers and hushed voices coming from upstairs. 
               The old man waits outside the room where the conversation is 
               taking place and listens on.

                         Oh no no no my Lord Voldemort. I only 
                         meant... perhaps if we were to do it 
                         without the boy..

                         NO! The boy is everything, it cannot 
                         be done without him and it WILL be done

               Wormtail stands in the doorway and looks at the old man. The 
               old man looks terrified.

<speech><character_speak>>HARRY</character_speak>
                         Pleasure to meet you too sir.

               They walk on up the hill.

               Camera homes in on a boot on top of the hillside.

</speech>

<speech><character_speak>>HARRY</character_speak>
                         Why are they all standing around that

<speech><character_speak>>GEORGE</character_speak>
                         It's a portkey.

               Everyone is in a circle putting their hands on the boot.

</speech>

<speech><character_speak>>AMOS</character_speak>
                         Time to go. Ready?

</speech>

<speech><character_speak>>HARRY</character_speak>
                         What's a 'portkey'?

</speech>

<speech><character_speak>>AMOS</character_speak>
                         Three!

               There's a white flash and suddenly they're all flying through 
               the air. Everyone cheers. 
 
</speech>

<speech><character_speak>>ARTHUR</character_speak>
                         Let go kids!

</speech>

<speech><character_speak>>ARTHUR</character_speak>
                         Let! Go!

              <character_ref>Harry</character_ref>, Hermione and the young Weasleys crash to the ground with 
               a thump. Arthur, Amos and Cedric come down more gracefully.

<speech><character_speak>>ARTHUR</character_speak>
                         I bet that cleared your sinuses eh?

<speech><character_speak>>HARRY</character_speak>
                         Thanks.

               They walk across the field and we see there's a massive crowd 
               gathered and cheering, tents are set up all over.

<speech><character_speak>>ARTHUR</character_speak>
                         Well kids, welcome to the Quidditch 
                         World Cup!
 
               They walk into the crowd, taking in the sights. Music is playing 
               and people fly about overhead on brooms. They approach a small 
               tent.

                         see you at the match.
 
               Amos and Cedric separate and walk off.

               They take their feet off the table and put them back on as soon 
               as Arthur has walked past.

               Five red figures this time, one of them performs a stunt on his 
               broom. One of them appears on the large screen. The crowd begins

               large ghostly skull forms in the sky with a snake crawling from

                         So Hogwarts has been choosen to host 
                         a legendary event. The Tri-Wizard tournament. 
                         Now for those of you who do not know, 
                         the tri-wizard tournament brings together 
                         three schools for a series of magical 
                         contests. From each school a single 
                         contestant is selected to compete. Now 
                         let me be clear, if choosen you stand 
                         alone. And trust me when I say these 
                         contests are not for the faint hearted, 
                         but more of that later. For now please 
                         join me in welcoming the lovely ladies 
                         of the Beauxbatons Academy of magic

                         you need to find somewhere else to put

                         this dream of yours. You mentioned Wormtail 
                         and Voldemort, but who was the third 
                         man in the room?

<speech><character_speak>>HARRY</character_speak>
                         No. Umm.. Voldemort was giving him a 
                         job to do. Something important.

                         was gonna use this man to get to me. 
                         I mean it was only a dream right?

                         name rising from that goblet these are 
                         not just coincidences. Hogwarts isn't

                         gonna last ten minutes in this tournament. 
                         He disagrees. He thinks you won't last

                         I don't give a damn what you or your 
                         father thinks Malfoy. He's vile and 
                         cruel, and you're just pathetic.
 
              <character_ref>Harry</character_ref> walks away and Draco angrily tries casting a spell. Mad-Eye 
               appears and quickly turns Malfoy into a ferret.

<speech><character_speak>>MAD-EYE</character_speak>
                         I'll teach you to cast when someone's

<speech><character_speak>>MAD-EYE</character_speak>
                         Technically it's a ferret.

               Mad-Eye is making the ferret hover around. He sends it up the 
               trouser leg of one of Draco's friends. He squirms and looks uncomfortable. 
               Everyone else is laughing. Mad-Eye winks to<character_ref>Harry</character_ref> and he laughs. 
               Eventually it comes back out and McGonagall turns Draco back 
               to normal.

                         Is that a threat! 

               Draco runs away. Mad-Eye shouts after him.

</speech>

<speech><character_speak>>MAD-EYE</character_speak>
                         I could tell you stories about your

                         He might've mentioned it.

                         fairy princess as I am. As for Krum, 
                         his head may be filled with sawdust 
                         but Karkaroff's is NOT. They'll have 
                         a strategy, and you can bet that it'll 
                         play to Krum's strengths. Hmm? Come

                         actually told me anything, so it was 
                         really me all along. I thought you'd

                         My dress robes.

<speech><character_speak>>RON</character_speak>
                         Well they're alright. No lace, no dodgy

<speech><character_speak>>HARRY</character_speak>

<speech><character_speak>>RON</character_speak>
                         Traditional?? They're ancient! I look

               He sniffs at his clothes.

<speech><character_speak>>HARRY</character_speak>

<speech><character_speak>>HARRY</character_speak>
                         Who?

</speech>

<speech><character_speak>>RON</character_speak>
                         Hermione of course. Come on<character_ref>Harry</character_ref>, why'd 
                         you think she wouldn't tell us who she's

</speech>

<speech><character_speak>>HARRY</character_speak>
                         Because we'd take the mickey out of 
                         her if she did.
 
</speech>

<speech><character_speak>>RON</character_speak>
                         Because nobody asked her. I would have 
                         taken her myself if she weren't so bleeding 
                         proud.

<speech><character_speak>>MCGONAGALL</character_speak>
                         To dance. It's traditional that the

                         are the first to dance. Surely I told

               Hermione walks down the stairs. Viktor Krum takes her hand and 
               they walk together.

               They dance. Soon others are joining in, Dumbledore and McGonagall, 
               Mr Filch and his cat, Hagrid and Madame Maxime. Mad-Eye sits 
               on the sidelines drinking. The scene changes, the music is now 
               rock played by the Weird Sisters fronted by Jarvis Cocker from 
               Pulp. Cool!. The crowd is jumping.<character_ref>Harry</character_ref>, Ron and their dates 
               are sitting some distance away looking miserable. Hermione comes 
               up after a great time with Viktor.

<speech><character_speak>>HERMIONE</character_speak>
                         The enemy?? Who was it wanting his autograph? 
                         Besides, the whole point of the tournament 
                         is international magical cooperation, 
                         to make friends.
 
</speech>

<speech><character_speak>>RON</character_speak>
                         Hrmph, I think he's got a bit more than

                         You are trying to figure this egg out

                         (Over a loudspeaker) Welcome to the 
                         second task. Last night something was 
                         stolen from each of our champions. A 
                         treasure of sorts. These four treasures, 
                         one for each champion, now lie on the 
                         bottom of the black lake. In order to 
                         win each champion need only find their 
                         treasure and return to the surface. 
                         Simple enough. Except for this, they 
                         will have one hour to do so and one 
                         hour only. After that they'll be on 
                         their own.

               The cannon fires and the champions enter the water, three of

               he pushes Ron and the girl towards the surface.

                         no longer private.

                         and I are done. I'll be back in a moment. 
                         Minister, after you.<character_ref>Harry</character_ref> do feel free 
                         to indulge in a liquorice snack in my 
                         absence, but I have to warn you they're 
                         a little bit sharp.
 
              <character_ref>Harry</character_ref> is left alone in the room. He puts his hand in the snackbowl 
               and takes a handful. It turns into a small creature which nips 
               at his hand.

               A compartment in the wall opens, there's a glowing blue pool 
               of water there. He looks in. He falls and lands in another time 
               and place. It's a courtroom, the walls have a red glow. Dumbledore

                         present evidence to this counsel. Should 
                         your testimony prove consequential. 
                         Counsel may be prepared to order your 
                         immediate release. Until such time you 
                         remain in the eyes of the ministry a 
                         convicted deatheater. Do you accept 
                         these terms?

                         I have names sir. There was a Rosier,

<speech><character_speak>>IGOR</character_speak>
                         No! No! There was Rookwood, he was a

<speech><character_speak>>BARTY</character_speak>
                         Augustus Rookwood? Of the department

<speech><character_speak>>IGOR</character_speak>
                         Ya ya, the same. He passed information

                         Very well. Counsel will deliberate. 
                         In the meantime you will be returned 
                         to Azkaban.

<speech><character_speak>>DUMBLEDORE</character_speak>
                         The counsel is very much aware you have 
                         given evidence on this matter. Severus 
                         Snape was indeed a deatheater and prior 
                         to Lord Voldemort's downfall turned 
                         spy for us at great personal risk. Today 
                         he's no more a deatheater than I am.

                         Curiosity's not a sin<character_ref>Harry</character_ref>, but you 
                         should exercise caution. It's a pensieve, 
                         useful if like me you find your mind 
                         a wee bit stretched. It allows me to 
                         see what small things I've already seen. 
                         You see<character_ref>Harry</character_ref> I've searched and searched 
                         for something, some small detail. Something 
                         I might have overlooked, something that 
                         would explain why these terrible things 
                         have happened. Every time I get close 
                         to an answer it slips away, it's maddedning.

                         Sir, Mr Crouch's son, what happened 
                         to him?
 
</speech>

<speech><character_speak>>DUMBLEDORE</character_speak>
                         He was sent to Azkaban. Destroyed Barty 
                         to do it. But he had no choice, the 
                         evidence was overwhelming. Why do you 
                         ask?
 
</speech>

<speech><character_speak>>HARRY</character_speak>
                         It's just that I had a dream about him. 
                         It was in the summer, before school. 
                         In the dream I was in a house and Voldemort 
                         was there only he wasn't quite human, 
                         and Wormtail was there too and Mr Crouch's 
                         son.
 
</speech>

<speech><character_speak>>DUMBLEDORE</character_speak>
                         Have there been other dreams like this?
 
                         
</speech>

<speech><character_speak>>HARRY</character_speak>
                         Yes. Always the same one. Sir... these 
                         dreams, what I see, you don't think 
                         it's actually happening do you?
 
</speech>

<speech><character_speak>>DUMBLEDORE</character_speak>
                         I think it's unwise for you to linger 
                         over these dreams<character_ref>Harry</character_ref>, I think it's 
                         best that you simply...

                         find not dragons or creatures of the 
                         deep. Instead you'll face something 
                         more challenging. You see, people change

                         My lord. Had I detected any sign or

<speech><character_speak>>VOLDEMORT</character_speak>
                         There were signs my friend, and more

<speech><character_speak>>LUCIUS</character_speak>
                         I assure you I never renounced the old

                         present each day since your absence,

                         Out of fear, not loyalty. Still you

<speech><character_speak>>VOLDEMORT</character_speak>
                        <character_ref>Harry</character_ref>! I'd almost forgotten you were 
                         here. Standing on the bones of my father. 
                         I'd introduce you but word has it you're 
                         almost as famous as me these days. The 
                         boy who lived. How lies have fed your 
                         legend<character_ref>Harry</character_ref>. Shall I reveal what really 
                         happened that night thirteen years ago? 
                         Shall I divulge how I truly lost my 
                         powers? It was love. You see when dear 
                         sweet Lily <character_ref>Potter</character_ref> gave her life for 
                         her only son she provided the ultimate 
                         protection. I could not touch you. It 
                         was old magic, something I should have 
                         forseen. But no matter, no matter. Things 
                         have changed, I can touch you now!
 
                         
               Voldemort puts his hand on<character_ref>Harry</character_ref>'s head and he screams.

<speech><character_speak>>VOLDEMORT</character_speak>

                         wand Potter. I said pick it up, get 
                         up. Get up! You've been taught how to 
                         duel I presume yes? First we bow to 
                         each other. Come on now<character_ref>Harry</character_ref> the niceties 
                         must be observed, Dumbledore would not 
                         want you to forget your manners now 
                         would he? I said bow!
 
               Voldemort forces<character_ref>Harry</character_ref> to bow with magic.

<speech><character_speak>>VOLDEMORT</character_speak>
                         That's better. And now...

<speech><character_speak>>VOLDEMORT</character_speak>
                         Atta boy<character_ref>Harry</character_ref>, your parents would be 
                         proud. Especially your filthy mongrel 
                         mother. I'm going to kill you<character_ref>Harry</character_ref> 
                         Potter, I'm going to destroy you. After 
                         tonight no one will ever again question 
                         my powers. After tonight if they speak 
                         of you they'll speak only of how you 
                         begged for death, and I being a merciful 
                         lord obliged. Get up.
 
               Voldemort pulls<character_ref>Harry</character_ref> to his feet,<character_ref>Harry</character_ref> begins to move away.

                         I kill you, I want to see the lights 
                         leave your eyes.

<speech><character_speak>>MAD-EYE</character_speak>
                         The dark lord. What was it like to stand 
                         in his presence?
 
</speech>

<speech><character_speak>>HARRY</character_speak>
                         I dunno. It was like I'd fallen into 
                         one of my dreams. One of my nightmares. 
                         
 
               Mad-Eye starts shaking and struggling for air, he reaches for 
               his bottle but it's empty. He rushes to a chest with other bottles 
               and struggles to find one.

                         Were there others? In the graveyard, 
                         were there others?

<speech><character_speak>>HARRY</character_speak>
                         Um. I don't think I said anything about 
                         a graveyard Professor.

                         Marvellous creatures dragons aren't 
                         they? Do you think that miserable oaf 
                         would have led you into the woods if 
                         I hadn't suggested it? Do you think 
                         Cedric Diggory would have told you to 
                         hold the egg under the water if I hadn't 
                         have told him first myself? Do you think 
                         Neville Longbottom the witless wonder 
                         could have provided you with gilliweed 
                         if I hadn't have given him the book 
                         that led you straight to it? Huh??

                         It was you from the beginning. You put 
                         my name in the goblet of fire. You bewitched 
                         Krum. But...
 
               Mad-Eye makes sobbing noises making fun of<character_ref>Harry</character_ref>.

                         You won because I made it so Potter. 
                         You ended up in that graveyard tonight 
                         because it was meant to be so. And now 
                         the deed is done. The blood that runs 
                         through these veins runs within the 
                         dark lord. Imagine how he will reward 
                         me when he learns that I have once and 
                         for all silenced the great <character_ref>Harry Potter</character_ref>.
 
                         
               A flash of magic occurs and Mad-Eye is knocked into the wall. 
               Dumbledore and Severus come rushing in. Dumbledore takes Mad-Eye 
               by the neck...

               Severus administers some veritaserum. Mad-Eye wriggles demonically.

               Dumbledore approaches the chest. The chest opens, it contains 
               a series of smaller chests. When the final chest is open we see 
               that there's a pit within holding a man the real Alastor Moody.

               Dumbledore looks into the pit.

                         We'll get you up in a minute.

               Alastor Moody groans. The Mad-Eye Moody they have captive in 
               a chair begins to twitch about restlessly making strange noises. 
               He appears to be transforming. He rips off his fake eyepiece 
               which falls on the floor, we see that he's transformed into Barty 
               Crouch Junior.

                         Perhaps. Personally I've never had much

<speech><character_speak>>DUMBLEDORE</character_speak>
                         (Speaking to all pupils) Today we acknowledge 
                         a really terrible loss. Cedric Diggory 
                         was as you all know, exceptionally hard 
                         working, intricately fair minded. And 
                         most importantly a fierce fierce friend. 
                         I think therefore you have the right 
                         to know exactly how he died. You see, 
                         Cedric Diggory was murdered by Lord 
                         Voldemort. The ministry of magic does 
                         not wish me to tell you this. But not 
                         to do so I think would be an insult 
                         to his memory. Now the pain we all feel 
                         at this dreadful loss reminds me, reminds 
                         us that while we may come from different 
                         places and speak in different tongues, 
                         our hearts beat as one. In light of 
                         recent events the bonds of friendship 
                         we made this year will be more important 
                         than ever. Remember that and Cedric 
                         Diggory will not have died in vain, 
                         you remember that. And we'll celebrate 
                         a boy who was kind and honest and brave 
                         and true right to the very end.

                         of course. I put you in terrible danger 
                         this year<character_ref>Harry</character_ref> I'm sorry.

                         Professor, when I was in the graveyard 
                         there was a moment... um... when Voldemort's 
                         wand and mine sort of connected.

                         the choice between what is right what 
                         is easy. But remember this, you have
