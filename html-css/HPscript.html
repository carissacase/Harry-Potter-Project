         <p>An old man lights a gas oven with a match, he is preparing food. 
            He notices a light on in the large house opposite, he stops what 
            he's doing and walks to the door.</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>OLD MAN</strong>
            Bloody kids.</p>
         
         
         <p>He leaves the house and heads towards the light.</p>

         <h4><i><strong>EXT. DARKNESS</strong></i></h4>
         
         
         <p>The old man is wandering up to the house carrying a lit torch.
            He opens the front door, inside is just as dark. He begins climbing 
            the stairs, we hear whispers and hushed voices coming from upstairs. 
            The old man waits outside the room where the conversation is 
            taking place and listens on.</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>WORMTAIL</strong>
            Oh no no no my Lord Voldemort. I only 
            meant... perhaps if we were to do it 
            without the boy..</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>VOLDEMORT</strong>
            NO! The boy is everything, it cannot 
            be done without him and it WILL be done 
            exactly as I say.</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>UNKNOWN MAN</strong>
            I will not disappoint you my lord.</p>
         
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>VOLDEMORT</strong>
            Good. First, gather our old comrades. 
            Send them a sign.</p>
         
         
         <p>A snake slithers past the old man and into the room. </p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>VOLDEMORT</strong>
            Nagini tells me the old caretaker is 
            standing outside the door.</p>
         
         
         <p>Wormtail stands in the doorway and looks at the old man. The 
            old man looks terrified.</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>VOLDEMORT</strong>
            Step aside so I can give our guest a 
            proper greeting.</p>

            Sorry Amos. Some of us had a bit of 
            a sleepy start. This is Amos Diggory
            everyone, he works with me at the ministry. 
            And this strapping young lad must be 
            Cedric, am I right?</p>

         <p><strong>HARRY</strong>
            Why are they all standing around that

         <p>Harry, Hermione and the young Weasleys crash to the ground with

            Thanks.</p>
         
         
         <p>They walk across the field and we see there's a massive crowd 
            gathered and cheering, tents are set up all over.</p>

         <p>They walk into the crowd, taking in the sights. Music is playing

            So Hogwarts has been choosen to host 
            a legendary event. The Tri-Wizard tournament. 
            Now for those of you who do not know, 
            the tri-wizard tournament brings together 
            three schools for a series of magical 
            contests. From each school a single 
            contestant is selected to compete. Now 
            let me be clear, if choosen you stand 
            alone. And trust me when I say these 
            contests are not for the faint hearted, 
            but more of that later. For now please 
            join me in welcoming the lovely ladies

            Hagrid's more than capable of seeing 
            to them.</p>

            Your attention please! I would like 
            to say a few words. Eternal glory, that 
            is what awaits the student who wins 
            the tri-wizard tournament. But to do 
            this that student must survive three

            For this reason the ministry has seen 
            fit to impose a new rule. To explain 
            all this we have the head of the department

            Bartimus Crouch.</p>
         
         
         <p>Thunder roars overhead, rain begins leaking through the roof 
            and screams break out. A strange man stands in the doorway, he 
            casts some magic upwards and seals the roof. Peace is restored.</p>

            He was a catcher. Half the cells in 
            Azkaban are full thanks to him. He's

            After much deliberation the ministry 
            has concluded that for their own safety 
            no student under the age of seventeen 
            shall be allowed to put forth their

            before this hour on Thursday night. 
            Do not do so lightly, if choosen there's

            Ministry malcontent. And your new defence 
            against the dark arts teacher. I'm here 
            because Dumbledore asked me, end of 
            story, goodbye, the end. Any questions? 
            When it comes to the dark arts, I believe 
            in a practical approach. But first, 
            which of you can tell me how many unforgivable

            Will earn you a one way ticket to Azkaban. 
            Correct. Now the ministry says you're 
            too young to see what these curses do. 
            I say different! You need to know what 
            you're up against, you need to be prepared, 
            you need to find somewhere else to put

            only an exceptionally powerful conjurer

            mask? does courage lie beneath those 
            curls? In short, what makes a champion

         <p>Her voice becomes desperate as he crumples up the newspaper and 
            puts it on the fire. The fire flares up a little, a face appears 
            in it.</p>

            Sirius?! How...</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>SIR</strong>
            I don't have much time Harry  so let 
            me get straight to it. Did you or did 
            you not put your name into the goblet 
            of fire?</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>HARRY</strong>
            No!</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>SIR</strong>
            Shh... I had to ask. Now, tell me about 
            this dream of yours. You mentioned Wormtail 
            and Voldemort, but who was the third 
            man in the room?</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>HARRY</strong>
            I dunno.</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>SIR</strong>
            You didn't hear a name?</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>HARRY</strong>
            No. Umm.. Voldemort was giving him a 
            job to do. Something important.</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>SIR</strong>
            What was that?</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>HARRY</strong>
            He wanted... me. I dunno why, but he 
            was gonna use this man to get to me. 
            I mean it was only a dream right?</p>
         
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>SIR</strong>
            Yes. It's just a dream. Look Harry , 
            the deatheaters at the world cup, your 
            name rising from that goblet these are 
            not just coincidences. Hogwarts isn't 
            safe any more.</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>HARRY</strong>
            What are you saying?</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>SIR</strong>
            I'm saying the devils are inside the 
            walls. Igor Karkaroff, he was a deatheater. 
            And no one, no one stops being a deatheater. 
            Then there's Barty Crouch, heart of 
            stone, sent his OWN son to Azkaban.</p>
         
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>HARRY</strong>
            Do you think one of them put my name 
            in the goblet?</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>SIR</strong>
            I haven't a clue who put your name in 
            that goblet Harry  but whoever did it 
            is no friend to you. People die in this 
            tournament.</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>HARRY</strong>
            I'm not ready for this Sirius.</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>SIR</strong>
            You don't have a choice.</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>HARRY</strong>
            Someone's coming!</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>SIR</strong>
            Keep your friends close Harry .</p>
         
         
         <p>Ron enters the room.</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>RON</strong>
            Who you talking to?</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>HARRY</strong>
            Who says I was talking to anyone.</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>RON</strong>
            I heard voices.</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>HARRY</strong>
            Maybe you're imagining things, wouldn't 
            be the first time.</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>RON</strong>
            You're probably just practicing for 
            your next interview I expect.</p>
         
         
         <p>Ron leaves. Harry  goes to the fire again but Sirius is gone. 
            The newspaper in the fire has the headline "TEENAGE TRAGEDY".</p>

         <p>Draco calls out, he's sitting up a tree.</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>DRACO</strong>
            Why so tense Potter? My father and I 
            have a bet you see. I don't think you're 
            gonna last ten minutes in this tournament. 
            He disagrees. He thinks you won't last 
            FIVE.</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>HARRY</strong>
            I don't give a damn what you or your 
            father thinks Malfoy. He's vile and 
            cruel, and you're just pathetic.</p>
         
         
         <p>Harry  walks away and Draco angrily tries casting a spell. Mad-Eye 
            appears and quickly turns Malfoy into a ferret.</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>MAD-EYE</strong>
            I'll teach you to cast when someone's 
            back is turned.</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>MCGONAGALL</strong>
            Professor Moody what are you doing?</p>
         
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>MAD-EYE</strong>
            Teaching.</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>MCGONAGALL</strong>
            Is that a student?</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>MAD-EYE</strong>
            Technically it's a ferret.</p>
         
         
         <p>Mad-Eye is making the ferret hover around. He sends it up the 
            trouser leg of one of Draco's friends. He squirms and looks uncomfortable. 
            Everyone else is laughing. Mad-Eye winks to Harry  and he laughs. 
            Eventually it comes back out and McGonagall turns Draco back 
            to normal.</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>DRACO</strong>
            My father will hear about this!</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>MAD-EYE</strong>
            Is that a threat!</p>
         
         
         <p>Draco runs away. Mad-Eye shouts after him.</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>MAD-EYE</strong>
            I could tell you stories about your 
            father that would curl even your greasy 
            hair boy! It doesn't end here!</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>MCGONAGALL</strong>
            We never use transfigration as a punishment, 
            surely Dumbledore told you that.</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>MAD-EYE</strong>
            He might've mentioned it.</p>

            Sit. Listen to me Potter. Your pal Diggory, 
            by your age he could take a whistle 
            into a watch and have it sing you the 
            time. Miss Delacour, she's as much a 
            fairy princess as I am. As for Krum, 
            his head may be filled with sawdust 
            but Karkaroff's is NOT. They'll have 
            a strategy, and you can bet that it'll 
            play to Krum's strengths. Hmm? Come 
            on Potter. What are your strengths?</p>

            The yule ball has been a tradition of 
            the tri-wizard tournament since its 
            inception. On Christmas eve night we 
            and our guests gather in the great hall 
            for well mannered frivolity. As representitives 
            of the host school I expect each and 
            every one of you to put your best foot 
            forward, and I mean this literally because 
            the yule ball is first and foremost... 
            a dance.</p>

            wanted to go to the ball with me.</p>

            Oh. Um. Harry  I'm sorry but someone's 
            already asked me. And well I've said 
            I'll go with him.</p>

            To dance. It's traditional that the 
            three champions or in this case four 
            are the first to dance. Surely I told

            Mr Filch and his cat, Hagrid and Madame Maxime. Mad-Eye sits 
            on the sidelines drinking. The scene changes, the music is now

            Pulp. Cool!. The crowd is jumping. Harry , Ron and their dates

            talk about the tournament. Actually 
            we didn't really talk at all, Viktor's 
            more of a physical being. I just mean 
            he's not particularly... Mostly he watches 
            me study. It's a bit annoying actually. 
            You are trying to figure this egg out 
            aren't you?</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>HARRY</strong>
            What's that supposed to mean?</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>HERMIONE</strong>
            I mean these tasks are supposed to test 
            you, in the most brutal way they're 
            almost cruel. And um, I'm scared for 
            you. You got by the dragon mostly on 
            nerve, I'm not sure it's going to be 
            enough this time.</p>

            It's not a bad place for a bath. Just

            (Over a loudspeaker) Welcome to the 
            second task. Last night something was 
            stolen from each of our champions. A 
            treasure of sorts. These four treasures, 
            one for each champion, now lie on the 
            bottom of the black lake. In order to 
            win each champion need only find their 
            treasure and return to the surface. 
            Simple enough. Except for this, they 
            will have one hour to do so and one 
            hour only. After that they'll be on 
            their own.</p>

            For showing unique command of the bubblehead 
            shark. The way I see it, Mr Potter would 
            have finished first had it not been 
            for his determination to rescue not 
            only Mr Weasley but the others as well. 
            We've agreed to award him second place! 
            For outstanding moral fibre.</p>

            Congratulations Potter, fine achievement. 
            Well done boy. I'm sorry we haven't 
            spoken, after all your story is one 
            I've heard many times. Quite remarkable. 
            Tragic of course, to lose one's family. 
            Never whole again are we? Still, life 
            goes on. And here we stand. I'm sure 
            your parents would be very proud today 
            Potter.</p>

            into one of the ministry's summer internships

            your testimony prove consequential. 
            Counsel may be prepared to order your 
            immediate release. Until such time you 
            remain in the eyes of the ministry a 
            convicted deatheater. Do you accept

            The counsel is very much aware you have

            Snape was indeed a deatheater and prior 
            to Lord Voldemort's downfall turned 
            spy for us at great personal risk. Today

            Curiosity's not a sin Harry , but you 
            should exercise caution. It's a pensieve, 
            useful if like me you find your mind 
            a wee bit stretched. It allows me to 
            see what small things I've already seen. 
            You see Harry  I've searched and searched 
            for something, some small detail. Something 
            I might have overlooked, something that 
            would explain why these terrible things 
            have happened. Every time I get close 
            to an answer it slips away, it's maddedning.</p>

            Sir, Mr Crouch's son, what happened 
            to him?</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>DUMBLEDORE</strong>
            He was sent to Azkaban. Destroyed Barty 
            to do it. But he had no choice, the 
            evidence was overwhelming. Why do you 
            ask?</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>HARRY</strong>
            It's just that I had a dream about him. 
            It was in the summer, before school. 
            In the dream I was in a house and Voldemort 
            was there only he wasn't quite human, 
            and Wormtail was there too and Mr Crouch's 
            son.</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>DUMBLEDORE</strong>
            Have there been other dreams like this?</p>
         
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>HARRY</strong>
            Yes. Always the same one. Sir... these 
            dreams, what I see, you don't think 
            it's actually happening do you?</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>DUMBLEDORE</strong>
            I think it's unwise for you to linger 
            over these dreams Harry , I think it's 
            best that you simply...</p>

            Ingenious. A rather rare herb gilliweed, 
            not something found in your every day 
            garden. Nor is this, know what it is?</p>

            Veritaserum. Three drops of this and 
            you-know-who himself will spill his 
            darkest secrets. The use of this on 
            a student is regrettably forbidden, 
            however should you ever steal from my

            just slip over your morning pumpkin

            Don't lie to me. Gilliweed might be 
            innocuous, but boomslang skin? lacewing 
            flies? You and your friends are brewing

            (continued) and Mr Potter tied for first

         <p><strong>DUMBLEDORE</strong>
            (continued) The first person to touch 
            the cup will be the winner. I've instructed 
            the staff to patrol the perimeter, if 
            at any point should a contestant wish 
            to withdraw from the task he or she 
            need only send up red sparks with their

            (To the contestants) In the maze you'll 
            find not dragons or creatures of the 
            deep. Instead you'll face something 
            more challenging. You see, people change 
            in the maze. Oh find the cup if you 
            can, but be very weary you could just 
            lose yourselves along the way.</p>

         <p>The cannon goes off. Mr Filch shrugs comically. Dumbledore groans. 
            Harry  and Cedric enter the maze through different entrances. 
            The entrance closes up behind Harry . Heavy mist sets in, we pan 
            out to see the maze is many stories tall. Harry  starts traversing 
            the maze, creature noises are all around.</p>
         
         
         <p>Cedric is walking along, the maze walls begin to close in on 
            him. He makes a run for it. Fleur is running around scared, she 
            is attacked and knocked down. Viktor comes along and sees she's 
            unconscious on the ground, he walks on. Harry  sees Fleur being 
            swallowed into the undergrowth.</p>

            Fleur? Fleur!</p>
         
         
         <p>He's too late she's disappeared. He sends up a red spark into 
            the air. A heavy wind starts blowing, walls are closing in, Harry  
            runs. Harry  sees something shining in the distance and he moves 
            towards it Viktor tries to zap him but misses.</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>CEDRIC</strong>
            Get down!</p>
         
         
         <p>Harry  ducks and Viktor gets zapped by Cedric. Cedric runs up 
            and kicks the wand out of Viktor's hand. He points his wand at 
            Viktor's body as if to finish him off, Harry  runs up and intervenes.</p>
         
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>HARRY</strong>
            No stop! He's bewitched Cedric.</p>
         
         
         <p>They struggle.</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>CEDRIC</strong>
            Get off me!</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>HARRY</strong>
            He's bewitched!</p>
         
         
         <p>The two of them begin running towards the cup. The undergrowth 
            grabs Cedric and he falls to the ground. Harry  looks back. Cedric 
            is pinned down with no means of escape.</p>

         <p>Harry  zaps the plantlife and Cedric wriggles free. Harry  helps

         <p><strong>VOLDEMORT</strong>
            Welcome my friends. Thirty years it's 
            been, and yet you stand before me as 
            though it were only yesterday. I confess 
            myself disappointed, not one of you 
            tried to find me.</p>
         
         
         <p>Voldemort begins slashing angrily at the hooded figures. </p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>VOLDEMORT</strong>
            
            Not even you, Lucius.</p> 
         
         
         
         <p><strong>LUCIUS</strong>
            My lord. Had I detected any sign or 
            even a whisper of your whereabouts.</p>
         
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>VOLDEMORT</strong>
            There were signs my friend, and more 
            than whispers.</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>LUCIUS</strong>
            I assure you I never renounced the old 
            ways. The face I have been obliged to 
            present each day since your absence, 
            that was my true mask.</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>WORMTAIL</strong>
            I returned.</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>VOLDEMORT</strong>
            Out of fear, not loyalty. Still you 
            have proved yourself useful these past 
            few months Wormtail.</p>
         
         
         <p>Voldemort grants Wormtail a new hand.</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>WORMTAIL</strong>
            Thank you master, thank you.</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>VOLDEMORT</strong>
            (To Cedric's corpse) Oh, such a handsome 
            boy.</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>HARRY</strong>
            Don't touch him.</p>
         
         
         <p>Harry struggles to get free.</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>VOLDEMORT</strong>
            Harry ! I'd almost forgotten you were 
            here. Standing on the bones of my father. 
            I'd introduce you but word has it you're 
            almost as famous as me these days. The 
            boy who lived. How lies have fed your 
            legend Harry . Shall I reveal what really 
            happened that night thirteen years ago? 
            Shall I divulge how I truly lost my 
            powers? It was love. You see when dear 
            sweet Lily Potter  gave her life for 
            her only son she provided the ultimate 
            protection. I could not touch you. It 
            was old magic, something I should have 
            forseen. But no matter, no matter. Things 
            have changed, I can touch you now!</p>
         
         
         
         <p>Voldemort puts his hand on Harry's head and he screams.</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>VOLDEMORT</strong>
            Astonishing what a few drops of your 
            blood will do eh Harry ? Pick up your 
            wand Potter. I said pick it up, get 
            up. Get up! You've been taught how to 
            duel I presume yes? First we bow to 
            each other. Come on now Harry  the niceties 
            must be observed, Dumbledore would not 
            want you to forget your manners now 
            would he? I said bow!</p>
         
         
         <p>Voldemort forces Harry  to bow with magic.</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>VOLDEMORT</strong>
            That's better. And now...</p>
         
         
         <p>Voldemort casts at Harry  and he wriggles in pain.</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>VOLDEMORT</strong>
            Atta boy Harry , your parents would be 
            proud. Especially your filthy mongrel 
            mother. I'm going to kill you Harry  
            Potter, I'm going to destroy you. After 
            tonight no one will ever again question 
            my powers. After tonight if they speak 
            of you they'll speak only of how you 
            begged for death, and I being a merciful 
            lord obliged. Get up.</p>
         
         
         <p>Voldemort pulls Harry  to his feet, Harry  begins to move away.</p>
         
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>VOLDEMORT</strong>
            Don't you turn your back on me Harry  
            Potter  I want you to look at me when 
            I kill you, I want to see the lights 
            leave your eyes.</p>
         
         
         <p>Harry  takes steps toward Voldemort.</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>HARRY</strong>
            Have it your way.</p>
         
         
         <p>They both cast and their streams of magic meet. They both struggle.</p>
         
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>VOLDEMORT</strong>
            Do nothing. He is mine to finish. He's 
            mine!</p>
         
         
         <p>Shapes form in the surrounding magical energy. We hear Dumbledore's 
            voice.</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>HARRY</strong>'S DAD
            (voice) Harry  when the connection is 
            broken you must get to the portkey. 
            We can delay it for a moment to give 
            you time but only a moment, do you understand?</p>
         
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>CEDRIC</strong>
            (voice) Harry  take my body back will 
            you? Take my body back to my father.</p>
         
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>HARRY</strong>'S MOTHER
            (voice) Let go. Sweetheart you're ready. 
            Let go! Let go!</p>
         
         
         <p>The connection breaks, Harry  runs over to Cedric's body and summons 
            the cup over to them. In an instant the port out. Voldemort looks 
            angry.</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>VOLDEMORT</strong>

         <p>Back at the arena Harry  appears with Cedric's body. The crowd 
            don't understand what has taken place and they all cheer, triumphant 
            music starts to play. Harry  weeps on Cedric's body. </p>

            He's back, he's back! Voldemort's back. 
            Cedric, he asked me to bring his body 
            back. I couldn't leave him, not there.</p>

            I'd better take a look at it.</p>
         
         
         <p>We see Harry 's arm, it has a skull and snake marking.</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>HARRY</strong>
            The cup was a portkey. Someone had bewitched

         <p><strong>HARRY</strong>

         <p><strong>MAD-EYE</strong>
            The dark lord. What was it like to stand 
            in his presence?</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>HARRY</strong>
            I dunno. It was like I'd fallen into 
            one of my dreams. One of my nightmares.</p>
         
         
         
         <p>Mad-Eye starts shaking and struggling for air, he reaches for 
            his bottle but it's empty. He rushes to a chest with other bottles 
            and struggles to find one.</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>MAD-EYE</strong>
            Were there others? In the graveyard,

         <p><strong>HARRY</strong>
            Um. I don't think I said anything about 
            a graveyard Professor.</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>MAD-EYE</strong>
            Marvellous creatures dragons aren't 
            they? Do you think that miserable oaf 
            would have led you into the woods if 
            I hadn't suggested it? Do you think 
            Cedric Diggory would have told you to 
            hold the egg under the water if I hadn't 
            have told him first myself? Do you think 
            Neville Longbottom the witless wonder 
            could have provided you with gilliweed 
            if I hadn't have given him the book 
            that led you straight to it? Huh??</p>
         
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>HARRY</strong>
            It was you from the beginning. You put

         <p><strong>MAD-EYE</strong>
            You won because I made it so Potter. 
            You ended up in that graveyard tonight 
            because it was meant to be so. And now 
            the deed is done. The blood that runs 
            through these veins runs within the 
            dark lord. Imagine how he will reward 
            me when he learns that I have once and 
            for all silenced the great  Harry Potter .</p>
         
         
         
         <p>A flash of magic occurs and Mad-Eye is knocked into the wall.

         <p>Dumbledore approaches the chest. The chest opens, it contains 
            a series of smaller chests. When the final chest is open we see 
            that there's a pit within holding a man the real Alastor Moody.</p>

            I'm sorry Albus.</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>HARRY</strong>
            That's Moody, but then who's...?</p>
         
         
         <p>Dumbledore holds up one of Mad-Eye's Bottles.</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>SEVERUS</strong>
            Polyjuice potion.</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>DUMBLEDORE</strong>
            Now we know who's been stealing it from 
            your store Severus.</p>
         
         
         <p>Dumbledore looks into the pit.</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>DUMBLEDORE</strong>
            We'll get you up in a minute.</p>
         
         
         <p>Alastor Moody groans. The Mad-Eye Moody they have captive in 
            a chair begins to twitch about restlessly making strange noises. 
            He appears to be transforming. He rips off his fake eyepiece

            You know what this means don't you? 
            He's back. Lord Voldemort has returned.</p>

            Send an owl to Azkaban, think they'll 
            find they're missing a prisoner.</p>

            Perhaps. Personally I've never had much

         <p><strong>DUMBLEDORE</strong>
            (Speaking to all pupils) Today we acknowledge 
            a really terrible loss. Cedric Diggory 
            was as you all know, exceptionally hard 
            working, intricately fair minded. And 
            most importantly a fierce fierce friend. 
            I think therefore you have the right 
            to know exactly how he died. You see, 
            Cedric Diggory was murdered by Lord 
            Voldemort. The ministry of magic does 
            not wish me to tell you this. But not 
            to do so I think would be an insult 
            to his memory. Now the pain we all feel 
            at this dreadful loss reminds me, reminds 
            us that while we may come from different 
            places and speak in different tongues, 
            our hearts beat as one. In light of 
            recent events the bonds of friendship 
            we made this year will be more important 
            than ever. Remember that and Cedric 
            Diggory will not have died in vain, 
            you remember that. And we'll celebrate 
            a boy who was kind and honest and brave 
            and true right to the very end.</p>

            I never liked these curtains. Set them 
            on fire in my fourth year, by accident 
            of course. I put you in terrible danger 
            this year Harry  I'm sorry.</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>HARRY</strong>
            Professor, when I was in the graveyard 
            there was a moment... um... when Voldemort's 
            wand and mine sort of connected.</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>DUMBLEDORE</strong>
            Priorium Contatum. You saw your parents 
            that night didn't you? They reappeared.</p>
         
         
         
         <p>Harry  nods.</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p><strong>DUMBLEDORE</strong>
            No spell can reawaken the dead Harry  
            I trust you know that. Dark and diffiult 
            times lie ahead. Soon we must all face 
            the choice between what is right what 
            is easy. But remember this, you have 
            friends here. You're not alone.</p>
