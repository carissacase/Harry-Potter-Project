        <h1>Goals</h1>
        <p>For our project, we thought it would be interesting to compare the Harry Potter: Goblet of Fire novel and movie to see how many differences there were in the plot. To illustrate the differences we took a look at the text of the book and the movie script to see a few different things: how many times certain characters were mentioned if at all, how many times spells were mentioned, how the scenes of the movie corresponded with the chapters of the book, and how many times creatures were mentioned.</p>
